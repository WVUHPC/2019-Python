## Exercises

  1. Compute the integral of the Spherical Bessel function of the first kind `spherical_jn` from 0 to 1

  2. Create a set of 20 random points in space and compute the convex hull.

  3. Remove on the points in that belong to the convex and recompute a new convex. Continue this procedure until you remain with just 3 points.

  4. Check the orthogonality of Legendre functions. For that you
  can use `scipy.special.eval_legendre`
